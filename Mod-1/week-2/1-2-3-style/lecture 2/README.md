Be sure to use those links specifically! Otherwise you might get pay-walled.

Also, some have asked for a formatting guide, here's a good one.

## Linters
With all of your assignments comes a "linter" that's a program that essentially checks your code for style. Don't ignore it! Be sure to run it before handing in your assignments! There are lots of great resources, check out this video on [eslint and vscode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fslNny60HzI).

## Opinions vs rules
But remember, you can find all sorts of opinions/facts on style guides by googling "JS Style Guides." Now, your company may do things differently, there really isn't a "right or wrong" style. The only *wrong* move here is not having style at all. You always want to write neat, readable code, no matter what.

Also, to clarify, you might hear people say "do not use tabs" that's not the same as "Do not use the tab _key_". A literal tab character ("\t") can be interpreted differently by different programs. However, *most* editors are configured that the tab key actually just types out 2 or 4 spaces. Please do not literally use the space bar. Spacing is important, we don't want odd numbers of spaces.
