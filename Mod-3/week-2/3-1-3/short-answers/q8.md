# Question

When we say "use semantic elements," what does that mean?

Please be sure to give an example of a semantic and non-semantic element in your explanation.

# Answer
```html
<!-- non -->
<div></div>
<span></span>

<!-- semantic -->
<article></article>
<header></header>

```
Non-semantic html uses non descriptive tags where as Semantic tags do. `div` we know is a container but we don't know what will go in that container. `header` make it clear that this is the header of the page.
