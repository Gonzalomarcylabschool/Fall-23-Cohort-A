# Question
Explain what the following status codes mean. Don't just copy and paste the default status text, tell us in your own words what the codes are for.

# Answer

200 OK (Success):
This code is the grand maestro of success, singing, "Your request was a symphony of perfection! Here's your well-deserved data, sir or madam."

When you send a request to a server, and it responds with a 200 status code, it means the server understood your request, processed it flawlessly, and is now sending back the expected data.

404 Not Found:
Ah, the elusive 404, the whispering wind of the digital realm. It solemnly declares, "Alas, what you seek is not within these virtual lands. Your quest ends in the vast nothingness of 'Not Found.'"

straightforward indicator that the requested resource could not be located on the server.

500 Internal Server Error:
The mighty 500, a thunderclap in the serverscape. It admits, "Dear user, something went awry in the kingdom of servers. Fear not; our digital artisans are working tirelessly to restore order. Your patience is our greatest ally in this hour of turmoil."

"I encountered an unexpected situation, and I'm not sure how to handle it." This could be due to a bug in the server-side code, a misconfiguration, or a temporary overload causing the server to stumble.
