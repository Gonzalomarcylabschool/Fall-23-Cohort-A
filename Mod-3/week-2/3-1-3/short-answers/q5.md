# Question

What is the danger behind inserting user entered information *directly* into the DOM unescaped?

# Answer

Can you trust the data? If you know the data isn't user generated (like status codes) then innerHTML is ok, but if you're ever entering text that could've come from a user, use nodes for safety. No malicious JS is going to sneak into our pages!

The dangers are:

Script Injection: If user inputs are not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject scripts (usually JavaScript) that will execute when other users view the page.

Cookie Theft: Malicious scripts can steal user cookies, enabling attackers to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to their accounts.

Phishing Attacks: Attackers can create realistic-looking phishing pages by injecting malicious scripts that capture sensitive information entered by users.

Defacement: XSS can be used to deface websites, causing harm to the site's reputation and trustworthiness.
