# Question

What does `element.append()` do? What is an advantage it has over `element.appendChild()`?

# Answer

The Element.append() method and Element.appendChild() method are both used to add an HTML element to the DOM (Document Object Model). However, they have some differences in terms of flexibility and usability.

The Element.append() method is a modern method introduced in the DOM specification. It allows you to append multiple nodes and strings to an element in a single call. It accepts a variable number of arguments, including nodes and strings, and appends them in the order they are provided.
```js
const parent = document.getElementById('parent');
const child1 = document.createElement('div');
const child2 = document.createElement('span');

parent.append(child1, 'Text content', child2);

```

Element.appendChild()
The Element.appendChild() method is an older method that appends a single node to the end of the list of children of a specified parent node. It takes a single argument, which is the node to be appended.

```js
const parent = document.getElementById('parent');
const child = document.createElement('div');

parent.appendChild(child);
```

While both methods achieve similar results, Element.append() is more versatile when you need to append multiple nodes or strings at once.
