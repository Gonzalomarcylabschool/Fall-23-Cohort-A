## Why Git? Also what is Git?

**Git** is a tool used for managing the files of repos.

This is what is known as a Version Control System(VCS). Unlike a most tools that save the progress, where the last save overwrite the previous version, a VCS will save a snapshot of where the project is at its current state and can be reverted back to a previous state if needed.

* Each saved version is called a commit. 
* You may decide to commit after completing a single function or an entire feature.
* Commits show the evolution & growth of a project.

## What is a repository?

**Repository** (or repo): a repository is where the history and different versions of a project are stored. Developers use repositories to collaborate on software projects, tracking changes, resolving conflicts, and maintaining different versions of the codebase.
