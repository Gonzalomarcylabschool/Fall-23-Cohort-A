## You will be able toâ€¦

* Understand what a command line interface (CLI) is.
* Compare and Contrast CLIs and Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
* Navigate your local file tree
* Create, copy, delete, and move files and directories
* How to run a JavaScript program using your CLI
* Explain what an "argument" is

## Key Terms:

* Command Line Interface (CLI)
* Graphical User Interface (GUI)
* Arguments
* Control + C
* Directory
* CRUD

### Commands 
```cli
pwd
ls
cd <directory>
../
./
mkdir <dir_name>
touch <file_name>
cp <file> <dest>
node <file_name>
```

## Why CLI and not GUI

You are probably use to using a **Graphical User Interface** or **GUI**. This is the thing you see when you start up your Computer or use your phone. You can click on things and see the visual version of the directories structure. Using your mouse and keyboard you can Create Read Update and Delete things with a click (or several). 

### Graphical User Interface (GUI) and why people use it.

A Graphical User Interface (GUI) has icons and buttons which are:  

**Intuitiveness**: generally more intuitive and user-friendly, especially for individuals who are not familiar with command line operations or coding. 

**Ease of Use**: They make it easy to perform tasks through point-and-click interactions. Users can navigate through the system and perform actions without needing to memorize or type specific commands.

**Visual Representation**: they provide a visual representation of the system, making it easier to understand complex structures and relationships.

**Reduced Learning Curve**: typically there is a lower learning curve, allowing users to quickly become productive without extensive training. 

**Accessibility**: GUIs can be designed to be accessible to people that are differently able. They can include features like screen readers, magnifiers, and keyboard shortcuts, making it easier for users with different abilities to interact with the software.


### Command Line Interface (CLI) any why WE will use it
A "Command Line Interface" (CLI) is a text-based interface for: 

* Controlling your computer.
* Create and delete new files/directories
* Navigate between directories
* List the contents of a directory
* Much more!
  * **Resource Efficiency**: CLI uses fewer system resources. This can be critical in server environments or when dealing with resource-constrained devices.

  * **Speed and Efficiency**: Experienced users often find it to be faster and more efficient, especially for repetitive tasks. Commands can be scripted and automated, saving time and reducing the chance of errors.

  * **Troubleshooting**: provides detailed error messages and logs, which are invaluable for diagnosing problems and troubleshooting. 

With time and practice you will find that using the CLI is so much more powerful to use and will allow you to do things that you didn't even know you could do.
