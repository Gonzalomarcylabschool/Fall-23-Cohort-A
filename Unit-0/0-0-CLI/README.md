## Why CLI and not GUI

### Command Line Interface (CLI)
A "Command Line Interface" (CLI) is a text-based interface for: 

* Controlling your computer.
* Create and delete new files/directories
* Navigate between directories
* List the contents of a directory
* Much more!
  * Resource Efficiency: CLI uses fewer system resources. This can be critical in server environments or when dealing with resource-constrained devices.
  * Speed and Efficiency: Experienced users often find it to be faster and more efficient, especially for repetitive tasks. Commands can be scripted and automated, saving time and reducing the chance of errors.
  * Troubleshooting: provides detailed error messages and logs, which are invaluable for diagnosing problems and troubleshooting. 

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

A Graphical User Interface (GUI) has icons and buttons. 

You can drag and click on things.
